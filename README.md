# Map-Coloring-Problem-Using-Constraint-Satisfaction-Techniques
This project solves the Map Coloring Problem using Constraint Satisfaction techniques such as DFS, Forward Checking, and Singleton Propagation, enhanced with MRV and LCV heuristics. It colors USA and Australia maps with minimum colors, displaying execution time, backtracking count, and visual graph outputs.
